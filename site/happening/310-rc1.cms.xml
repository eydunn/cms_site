                Lift is the most powerful, secure and mature web framework available today. There are
                <a href="https://seventhings.liftweb.net/" target="_blank">Seven Things</a>
                that distinguish Lift from other web frameworks.
              </p>

              <p>Lift applications are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Secure -- Lift apps are resistant to common vulnerabilities including many of the OWASP Top 10</li>
                <li>Developer centric -- Lift apps are fast to build, concise and easy to maintain</li>
                <li>Scalable -- Lift apps are high performance and scale in the real world to handle insane traffic levels</li>
                <li>Interactive like a desktop app -- Lift's Comet support is unparalleled and Lift's ajax support is super-easy and very secure</li>
                <li>Modular -- Lift apps can benefit from, easy to integrate, pre built modules</li>
                <li>Designer friendly -- Lift apps can be developed in a totally designer friendly way</li>
              </ul>
