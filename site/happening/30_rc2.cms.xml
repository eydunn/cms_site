          <p>The Lift team proudly announces the <a href="/download">availability</a>
            of Release Candidate 2 of Lift version 3.0.
          </p>
          <p>Lift is the most powerful, secure and mature web framework available today. There are
            Seven Things
            that distinguish Lift from other web frameworks.
          </p>

          <p>Lift applications are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Secure -- Lift apps are resistant to common vulnerabilities including many of the OWASP Top 10</li>
            <li>Developer centric -- Lift apps are fast to build, concise and easy to maintain</li>
            <li>Scalable -- Lift apps are high performance and scale in the real world to handle insane traffic levels</li>
            <li>Interactive like a desktop app -- Lift's Comet support is unparalleled and Lift's ajax support is super-easy and very secure</li>
            <li>Modular -- Lift apps can benefit from, easy to integrate, pre built modules</li>
            <li>Designer friendly -- Lift apps can be developed in a totally designer friendly way</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Read an <a href="/lift_overview">overview</a> of how Lift achieves these important goals.</p>

          <!-- **** START OF CHANGES PASTED FROM GITHUB RELEASE NOTES *********************** -->

          <div class="markdown-body">
            <h3>Fixes</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/lift/framework/pull/1783">(#1783)</a> JsCmds that produced HTML with events and eagerly evaluated
                 that HTML content (e.g. by declaring a val toJsCmd instead of def toJsCmd) would produce the event handler JS even if the JsCmd in
                 question was never sent down to the client. We now tie the JS for event handling to the JsCmd's content directly, so this pitfall can't be triggered.

                 Thanks to Riccardo Sirigu for reporting this issue on the mailing list.
