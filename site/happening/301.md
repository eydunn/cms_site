# Announcing Lift 3.0.1

_December 13, 2016_

The Lift team proudly announces the [availability](/download) of Lift version
3.0.1 Final.

Lift is the most powerful, secure, and mature web framework available today.
There are [Seven Things](shttps://seventhings.liftweb.net/) that distinguish
Lift from other web frameworks.

Lift applications are:

 - Secure -- Lift apps are resistant to common vulnerabilities including many of the OWASP Top 10
 - Developer centric -- Lift apps are fast to build, concise, and easy to maintain
 - Scalable -- Lift apps are high performance and scale in the real world to handle insane traffic levels
 - Interactive like a desktop app -- Lift's comet support is unparalleled and Lift's ajax support is super-easy and very secure
 - Modular -- Lift apps can benefit from easy-to-integrate prebuilt modules
 - Designer friendly -- Lift apps can be developed in a totally designer friendly way

Read an [overview](/lift_overview) of how Lift achieves these important goals.

Lift open source software licensed under an Apache 2.0 license.
