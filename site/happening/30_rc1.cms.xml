          <p>The Lift team proudly announces the <a href="/download">availability</a>
            of Release Candidate 1 of Lift version 3.0.
          </p>
          <p>Lift is the most powerful, secure and mature web framework available today. There are
            Seven Things
            that distinguish Lift from other web frameworks.
          </p>

          <p>Lift applications are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Secure -- Lift apps are resistant to common vulnerabilities including many of the OWASP Top 10</li>
            <li>Developer centric -- Lift apps are fast to build, concise and easy to maintain</li>
            <li>Scalable -- Lift apps are high performance and scale in the real world to handle insane traffic levels</li>
            <li>Interactive like a desktop app -- Lift's Comet support is unparalleled and Lift's ajax support is super-easy and very secure</li>
            <li>Modular -- Lift apps can benefit from, easy to integrate, pre built modules</li>
            <li>Designer friendly -- Lift apps can be developed in a totally designer friendly way</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Read an <a href="/lift_overview">overview</a> of how Lift achieves these important goals.</p>

            <h3>Breaking Changes</h3>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/lift/framework/pull/1766">(#1766)</a> lift-json's <code>\\</code> used to return a JValue.
              In cases where it matched a single field directly, it would return the field's value rather than a consistent container type.
              Matching multiple fields would return a JObject with the matched fields in it.
              Now, <code>\\</code> always returns a **JObject** with the matching fields in it, even if there is only one such field.
              This may require adapting certain uses of <code>\\</code>, especially in for comprehensions.
              Code like <code>for (JString(name) &lt;- object \\ "name")</code> will have to be changed to something more like
               <code>for (JField(_, JString(name)) &lt;- object \\ "name")</code> to work correctly.

               <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/lift/framework/pull/1773">(#1773)</a>,
               <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/lift/framework/pull/1779">(#1779)</a> Lift was depending on
               outdated versions of many libraries.
               We've bumped those dependencies, so we now depend on **specs2 3.7** and **Java Servlet 3.1**.
               All other version bumps were non-major, including **lift-json-scalaz** now depending on **Scalaz 7.2**.
               See the dependency file's diff for the full breakdown of dependency updates.
             </li>

            <h3>Improvements</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/lift/framework/pull/1772">(#1772)</a>
                 When JsCmds including Noop were combined with <code>&amp;</code>, you would get a lot of empty lines,
                 since each Noop would emit some empty lines in those cases.
                 Now, we ignore Noop when combining <code>JsCmds</code>, which should lead to reduced noise in serialized JS output.
                 The most immediate impact is that page-specific JavaScript will be much more compact than it was before.
                Fixes
              </li>
              <li>
                <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/lift/framework/pull/1779">(#1779)</a> <code>Props.whereToLook</code> works
                correctly again. In **3.0-M8**, we expanded the abilities of <code>Props</code> to read from arbitrary sources.
                Unfortunately, in the process, we broke the <code>whereToLook</code> setting that allowed you to adjust the search paths
                for <code>Props</code> to look for named property files. This has been fixed in **RC1**.

              </li>
              <li>
                <a class="issue-link" href="https://github.com/lift/framework/pull/1769">(#1769)</a> Lift's JavaScript settings customization
                was set up such that you couldn't override things provided by **Lift's liftVanilla** or **liftJQuery** objects.
                This is now fixed, so custom JavaScript settings can build on and override those base functions.
                Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/joescii">@joescii</a> for reportingâ€¦ And fixing! ;)
